Sometimes the current captouch will suddenly light by itself. I think this is
because of atmospheric changes. The current sensor has no ground plane and is
very sensitive to other fields.

After measuring for some hours:
- I see a recurring pattern every 40 measurements. It looks like half of a
  sine, both above and below the mean. My guess at this time is that this is
  the ac 50Hz humm that we measure, and because our measurement is at 17Hz we
  sample a different part of the ac wave every measurement.

Some thoughts:
- Include a ground plane under the sensor to improve noise behavior

- Add a high pass filter to filter out any low tones. Note that although our
  "measurement" is at 17Hz, the output pin is toggled at 1Mhz during 8ms. This
  means that most any high pass filter above 50Hz is ok.

  f_c = 1 / (2 pi RC)

  Taking for instance a R of 470k and a C of 470pF yields a f_c of 28kHz. With
  this filter the 50Hz hum is gone.

  Schematic has been updated with a 805 places for a R C in the sensor path.

- Improve detection of touch by:
  - Only considering an average over the last x measurements as new data
  - Taking the differential between the new and the last data
  - And if that diff is large enough add to an integrand
  - Leak the integrand away over time, enforce that a touch needs to
    happen within a number of seconds

  The diff and int can be bounded to ensure that small changes (diff)
  accumulate. The average should filter away most drift. The integrand
  makes sure that a number of small changes over time are counted
  together as a touch.
