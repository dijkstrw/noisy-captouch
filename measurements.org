Sometimes the current captouch will suddenly light by itself. I think this is
because of atmospheric changes. The current sensor has no ground plane and is
very sensitive to other fields.

After measuring for some hours:
- I see a recurring pattern every 40 measurements. It looks like half of a
  sine, both above and below the mean. My guess at this time is that this is
  the ac 50Hz humm that we measure, and because our measurement is at 17Hz we
  sample a different part of the ac wave every measurement.

I'm guessing that including a ground plane to improve noise behavior is an
important next step.
